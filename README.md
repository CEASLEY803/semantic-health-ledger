# Semantic Health Ledger

Log supplements, biometrics, lab results, and journal entries in plain text. Gemini extracts and routes structured data into a local SQLite database. Everything stays on your machine — nothing is stored in the cloud except the Gemini API call itself.

---

## Before you start

You need three things installed:

| Tool | Minimum | Get it |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.9+ (3.11 recommended) | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Gemini API key | — | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) (free tier works) |

---

## Option A — Run from source (recommended for dev)

**Step 1.** Double-click **`setup.bat`** in the project root.
- Creates the Python virtual environment
- Installs all Python and Node dependencies
- Creates `.env` and prompts you for your Gemini API key
- Initialises the SQLite database

**Step 2.** Double-click **`LaunchLedger.vbs`** any time you want to open the app.
- Kills any stale processes on the backend ports
- Opens a terminal and starts the app in dev mode (hot-reload)

That's it. You don't need to touch anything else for day-to-day use.

---

## Option B — Install as a Windows app

This builds a proper `.exe` installer so the app appears in your Start menu like any other Windows program. **You must complete Option A setup first** — the installed app still reads your `.env` and uses the Python backend from this project folder.

**Step 1.** Complete Option A (setup.bat + confirm the app runs in dev mode).

**Step 2.** Open a terminal in the project root and run:
```
.\ledger.ps1 build
```
This compiles the frontend, packages it as a native app, and copies the installer to the project root when it finishes.

**Step 3.** Double-click the **`Health Ledger_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`** that appears in the project root.

The installer registers the app with Windows. You can now launch it from the Start menu.

> **Note:** If you move or rename the project folder after installing, re-run `setup.bat` to re-register the new path, then re-install.

## Developer commands

All dev operations go through `ledger.ps1`. Open a terminal in the project root:

```powershell
.\ledger.ps1 setup    # first-time install
.\ledger.ps1 dev      # kill ports + start dev mode (same as LaunchLedger.vbs)
.\ledger.ps1 build    # build production installer
.\ledger.ps1 kill     # free ports 8787 / 3000 / 3001 without starting anything
.\ledger.ps1 help     # print this list
```

The CLI (for querying the database directly, testing extraction, etc.):
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe ledger_cli.py help
```

---

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env` (created automatically by `setup.bat`). The only required value is your API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Everything else has sensible defaults. Optional overrides:

```env
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
DATABASE_PATH=data/ledger.sqlite3
MEM0_USER_ID=primary_user
MEM0_QDRANT_PATH=data/memory/qdrant
MEM0_COLLECTION_NAME=health_ledger_semantic
```

---

## Architecture

```
Tauri desktop window
  └─ Next.js 15 frontend (port 3000, Turbopack)
       ├─ Chat Panel   →  POST /api/v1/chat/ingest   (SSE stream)
       └─ Dashboard    ←  GET  /api/v1/get/history?entry_type=...

FastAPI backend (port 8787) — spawned automatically by Tauri
  ├─ api.py           →  routing, SSE streaming, Garmin sync
  ├─ llm_service.py   →  Gemini 2.5 Flash (extraction) + Pro (conversation)
  ├─ memory_layer.py  →  Mem0 + local Qdrant (semantic recall)
  └─ init_storage.py  →  SQLite WAL + 4-table schema
```

All data is local. The only outbound traffic is Gemini API calls.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`GEMINI_API_KEY is not set`**
Open `.env` and confirm `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here` is filled in. Then restart the app.

**App won't start / "virtual environment not found"**
Run `setup.bat` again. It's safe to re-run and won't overwrite your data or `.env`.

**Dashboard shows "Failed to fetch"**
The backend is still starting. Wait 5–10 seconds and refresh. If it persists, check `logs\backend.log` for errors.

**Installed app stopped working after moving the project folder**
Re-run `setup.bat` from the new location to re-register the path, then reinstall using `.\ledger.ps1 build`.

**Ports already in use**
Run `.\ledger.ps1 kill` or double-click `LaunchLedger.vbs` (it kills stale ports automatically before launching).

**Mem0 / semantic memory is slow on first run**
Normal — Qdrant initialises an on-disk collection and loads the embedding model on the first call. Subsequent calls are fast.

## Data location

All data is local and excluded from version control:

```
data/
├── ledger.db              # structured ledger (compounds, biometrics, labs, journals)
└── memory/
    ├── qdrant/            # local vector store
    └── mem0_state/        # Mem0 state directory
logs/
└── backend.log            # backend stdout/stderr
```

To reset everything (PowerShell):
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force data\
.venv\Scripts\python.exe init_storage.py
```
